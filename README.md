# googletranslate

This is the demo explanation for google translator using googletrans library. It converts english sentences to bengali using google translator API. Here I have used .xlsx. Every row is translated and saved to .csv format. 

Sample .csv contains 10 rows but the actual program .ipynb can be used to generate as much as you can because I have removed the `df = df[:10]` from the code.
